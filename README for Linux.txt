How to install and run on Linux?

(1) Install Dependencies first using Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh
(2) Run application by using DPCS.jar

NOTE: Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh currently only supports linux distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint (all linux distros which use APT package manager). You would need to modify Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh to install on Distributions like Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Arch Linux, etc.
